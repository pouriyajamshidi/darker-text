# Darker Text For YouTube

This extension reduces eye-strain by decreasing the sharpness of the white text on YouTube when using dark theme as well as increasing the font size of the comments by one.

## NOTE

At this stage, the functionality and structure of this extension is very basic and I plan to continue working on it the more I learn about JavaScript, HTML and CSS in my free time.

## Usage

Clone this repository, head to your browser's extension settings, enable developer mode, click on `Load unpacked` and select the cloned directory.

## Tested on

- Google Chrome
- Opera

## Ideas

- [ ] Add a color pallette to choose a custom color
- [ ] Refactor the script
- [ ] Create a proper logo
