# Darker Text For YouTube

This extension reduces eye-strain by decreasing the sharpness of the text on YouTube when using dark theme.

## NOTE

At this stage, the functionality and structure of this extension is very basic and I plan to continue working on it the more I learn about JavaScript, HTML and CSS in my free time.

## Ideas

- [ ] Add a color pallette to choose a custom color
- [ ] Refactor the script
- [ ] Create a proper logo
